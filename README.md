# Crafter
## Minecraft but in Cython

## Brief

Inspired by [fogleman/Minecraft](https://github.com/fogleman/Minecraft), I
wanted to fork off their work and extend it to encapsulate a more modern feel.

### Tech Stack

 - Python3.8
 - Cython
 - Pyglet(OpenGL)

## Running

 - `make run` should have you covered (open an issue if it doesnt.)
